# Airline Cancellation Rates and Causes
## by Alexander Coffin


## Dataset

> The dataset I picked was the Flight information from 2004 to 2008 to determine what was the biggest cause for delays along with which carrier is historically the least reliable based on cancellations over the 5 year period.  This dataset has been pulled from a larger data set that was downsampled to compile a dataset that did not require 10+ seconds for processing.  Each year had 100000 samples pulled into a new dataframe for reference and to give the sampling a spread over the entire year.  2003 was not able to be included as parts of the data were corrupt causing an issue with combining the frames.

> In order to dig deeper into the data to answer the question of what the drove cancellations and who was the biggest culprit we needed to create a new dataset under Cancelled-Record.  This allows us to skip the data cleaning process and jump right into the analysis at a later date.
